# Bootstrap Process (build.ps1)

The `build.ps1` script is the entry point for all build operations. It bootstraps the environment without assuming any pre-existing setup.

### What build.ps1 Does

1. **Updates `$env:PSModulePath`** — prepends `output/` and `output/RequiredModules/` so build dependencies are discoverable
2. **(Optional) Ensures PowerShellGet v2+** — only if using legacy PowerShellGet
3. **Downloads bootstrap modules** — `PowerShell-yaml` and `PSDepend`
4. **Reads `build.yaml`** — loads the build configuration
5. **Installs NuGet provider** — if not present (proxy-aware)
6. **Resolves dependencies** — downloads modules listed in `RequiredModules.psd1` to `output/RequiredModules/`
7. **Invokes build tasks** — hands off to `Invoke-Build` to run the requested workflow

### Common Invocations

> **CRITICAL**: Never run `./build.ps1` directly inside the VS Code integrated terminal's
> current PowerShell session. The build process imports modules, invokes Pester, and runs
> long-lived tasks that can **block the PowerShell extension thread and freeze VS Code**.
> Always invoke `build.ps1` through the fully detached `Start-Process` wrapper
> in `powershell-execution-safety.instructions.md`.

Choose one line as the wrapper's inner child payload:

```text
# First run: resolve dependencies + full default workflow
./build.ps1 -ResolveDependency

# Build only (skip tests)
./build.ps1 -Tasks build

# Test only (module must already be built)
./build.ps1 -Tasks test

# Build and package as NuGet
./build.ps1 -Tasks pack

# Run bootstrap task without build/test (child process only)
./build.ps1 -Tasks noop

# Resolve dependencies only
./build.ps1 -ResolveDependency -Tasks noop

# List all available tasks
./build.ps1 -Tasks ?

# Run specific test file
./build.ps1 -Tasks test -PesterPath 'tests/Unit/Public/Get-Widget.tests.ps1' -CodeCoverageThreshold 0

# Run specific test folder
./build.ps1 -Tasks test -PesterPath 'tests/QA' -CodeCoverageThreshold 0

# Run integration tests (not included in default test workflow)
./build.ps1 -Tasks test -PesterPath 'tests/Integration' -CodeCoverageThreshold 0
```

### Why a Separate Process?

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| VS Code hangs during build | `build.ps1` blocks the PowerShell extension or terminal pipe | Fully detached `Start-Process` + encoded child payload |
| Module state leaks between builds | `Import-Module -Force` in-process may not fully unload assemblies | A new process starts clean |
| Stale `$env:PSModulePath` | Previous build runs prepend paths that accumulate | `-NoProfile` starts with a default `PSModulePath` |
| Pester `InModuleScope` deadlocks | Locking conflicts with the language server | Isolated process avoids shared locks |

### When to Use -ResolveDependency

| Scenario | Use `-ResolveDependency`? |
|---|---|
| First clone / fresh checkout | **Yes** |
| `RequiredModules.psd1` changed | **Yes** |
| Updating to latest dependency versions | **Yes** |
| Normal iterative development | **No** (if `output/RequiredModules/` is populated) |
| CI/CD build agent (always clean) | **Yes** |

> **Note**: `-ResolveDependency` downloads but never removes. If you remove a module from `RequiredModules.psd1`, manually delete it from `output/RequiredModules/`.
