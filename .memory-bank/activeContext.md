# Active context

## Current focus

[CI run 36549550887](https://github.com/raandree/CopilotAtelier/actions/runs/36549550887)
is PR #26's check: the automated v5.0.0 rollover failed only the manifest
version guard on all three platforms (`plugin.json` 4.0.0 under `[5.0.0]`).
`main` is already green: #25 merged as `314c795` with the manifest bump, and
push run `36553689149` passed and published `v6.0.0-preview0001`.

`ai/rollover-plugin-manifest` (local, not pushed) fixes the cause for the next
full release. `Update_PluginManifest_Version` runs `-Before
Create_ChangeLog_GitHub_PR`, rewrites only the manifest version for the full
release tag at `origin/main`, and sets `rebase.autoStash`, without which
Sampler's rebase pull refuses the modified tree. `GitHubFilesToAdd` commits
`plugin.json`; CI admission validates changelog- or manifest-only main pushes
without republishing. Red 8 of 29; two mutation runs caught their guards;
focused 65/0/0; the real build lists the task inside the rollover task.

GitVersion's case-insensitive `major-version-bump-message` matched "Major" in
the #25 review-record text, so `main` now versions 6.0.0; tightening the
pattern or accepting 6.0.0 is a pending user decision.

PR #25 carried the eval-gate hardening and review follow-ups (F1-F4, N1-N3,
P1/P2); the independent approval covers `7a186c5..2b45419`, not the
follow-ups. Details remain in `progress.md` and git.

## Previous plan-review work

PR-01 through PR-09 and the CONDITIONAL review's heading-verifier coverage gap
are resolved in the integrated tree. The verifier is mandatory and every server
read is checked by the dependency-free gate; excessive JSON nesting is refused.
Per-launch sessions, bounded state, ownership locks, parser-verified anchors,
source rechecks, immutable assets, and revision-scoped drafts remain intact.
The guide, threat model, and `assessment-log.md` retain the full contracts and
original findings. Browser feedback never grants chat sign-off authority.

Earlier local evidence: Windows gate 1,775/0/116 at 90.72% coverage; Node 255;
Edge 42. This did not prove the failing cross-platform artifact transfer.
No fresh independent review of the combined HTTP and persistence corrections
is claimed; `review: on` remains recommended for those earlier changes.

## Previous focuses

- **Client-specific adapters (task 06, `288a4ad`).** VS Code profiles remain the
  source; the adapter rewrites strictly parsed frontmatter through explicit
  capability mappings, rejects unsupported grants, and preserves the body bytes.
  CLI `review: on` and `cycle: full` are refused in the generated variant.
  Neither client is runtime verified; authored cases sit in
  `docs/client-adapter-evals.md`. Generated variants are undeployed artifacts
  under `output/clientAdapters`, owned through a schema 2 manifest recording
  SHA-256 that refuses an unowned or modified collision. Round 2: 121 passed.
- **Changed-file validation (task 05).** An opt-in, bounded validation pass over
  one work batch, collected manually because no documented hook event reports an
  edit contract this implementation has verified. Validators read an isolated
  snapshot, and a receipt binds to those bytes plus a plan identity hashing the
  linter entry point and the shipped checker code. Parse and PSScriptAnalyzer
  run in an owned child worker. `Markdown.NativeStructure` is `coverage=partial`
  and never stands in for markdownlint. 12 red, then 85/0/0.
- **Skill health report (task 04).** Read-only `Get-CopilotAtelierSkillHealth`
  with private import and measure helpers. The client-event contract is
  verified, not asserted, and the report publishes *no reliable Skill-activation
  contract verified for this implementation*. Missing telemetry is unknown, not
  zero: output counts only through a validated provenance sidecar, and
  disagreeing copies surface as `ConflictingRun`. Red 29 then 81/0.
- **Reviewed learning inbox (task 03).** An on-demand, project-scoped review
  queue whose store sits outside the routed base and the deployed tree. A
  selected artifact is an untrusted observation, never a directive; one content
  rule runs at intake and again at promotion, which is append-only and hash-gated
  on `-Approve` plus the preview SHA-256. Red 18 of 62 then 62/0/0.
- **Installation profiles (task 02).** `-InstallationProfile` plus
  `-IncludeSkill`/`-ExcludeSkill` on Install, Update, and Setup, with
  `Get-CopilotAtelierProfile`. Only Skills are selectable; `memory-bank`,
  `long-running-job-monitor`, and `agent-security-review` are mandatory because
  deployed Instructions and shipped agents load them by name. The selection is
  an additive optional `Selection` field inside schema 1.
- **Footprint reporting (task 01), CI run 34061934611, and Agent Plugins 1.0.**
  `Get-CopilotAtelierFootprint` reports potential loading contingent on
  discovery, guards every mapped root, and fails closed on ambiguous
  frontmatter. The CI fix landed at `35fa926` and the deployment review's M1-M5
  and L1-L6 at `5acb69d` with zero Blocker or Major findings, per-ID detail in
  `assessment-log.md`. VS Code documents all four Copilot-only component paths
  under `com.github.copilot/`, so only the accepted cross-type-link mismatch
  remains open against Decision 0023.

## Environment hazard — scripted bulk writes corrupt file content

Two bulk PowerShell read-modify-write passes over this working tree replaced
whole file contents with a monoalphabetic substitution cipher (`instructions`
→ `nnkteuotnonk`, `applyTo` → `aeelyTo`), 129 files each time. Both were caught
and restored from git; no corruption reached a commit. It is asynchronous: the
script's own byte-exact read-back passed and `git diff` showed it afterwards, so
a verify-after-write loop cannot detect it. Edit through the editor tooling and
treat any scripted bulk rewrite as unsafe; `git grep -l -e nnkteuotnon -e
aeelyTo` detects it.

## Blocked, not deferred

On 2026-09-08 ShellPilot and `Invoke-ShpBatch` are installed, and
`Test-ShpCiReadiness -NonInteractive` reports ready with the existing Copilot
backend. The wiki case used it with candidate-scoped read-only tools and no
browsing, terminal, user tools, or MCP. Its ten paired requests plus one setup
pilot made no Skill loads, writes, or shell calls. Waza and its native extension
are absent; the earlier Copilot CLI check also reported it unavailable.
No graded body comparison exists. The bundled matcher aggregates independent
reviewer verdicts, not investigative actions or candidate-authored PASS text.
Earlier route-selection and trigger-query sets remain unmeasured.

## Open findings

- **High:** `software-engineer-contoso` claims no egress while retaining an
  unrestricted terminal and mandating a generic `security-reviewer` delegate
  with web, GitHub, MCP, and terminal tools. Eleven older agents likewise
  combine workspace and private-data access, untrusted web content, arbitrary
  execution, and broad MCP access. Prose is not enforced containment, especially
  on native Windows without terminal sandboxing; replace copied omnibus tool
  lists with role-specific least-privilege surfaces.
- **Major:** `career-coach` (35,672 chars), `research-analyst` (43,376),
  `security-reviewer` (43,772), and `technical-writer` (35,018) exceed GitHub's
  30,000-character Custom agent prompt limit. The new test prevents growth; the
  separate Session handoff owns the refactor below the limit.
- **Major:** every profile omits `target` but declares a VS Code model-priority
  array and mostly VS Code-qualified tool IDs. Copilot CLI documents one model
  string plus CLI tool names; product-specific profiles or a shared compatible
  subset remain open.
- **Medium:** Security Reviewer and Technical Writer delegate research to the
  full `research-analyst` profile, and twelve agents expose `browser` while only
  Software Engineer carries an explicit ephemeral-loopback,
  shared-authentication, and user-confirmation contract.
- **Medium:** no executed agent behavioral eval set exists; the semantic tests
  catch structural regressions only. Under Windows PowerShell 5.1,
  `Get-FileHash` is unresolvable inside a script invoked from a Pester `It`,
  which the untouched `MemoryBankRoleMigration` suite reproduces — a harness
  anomaly, not a code defect.
- **Low:** three test files parse agent frontmatter with independent regular
  expressions; one shared `powershell-yaml` parser plus malformed nested
  fixtures would reduce false greens. The deployment review's M1-M5 and L1-L6
  are approved on the verified scope; macOS and live cloud sync stay disclosed.

## Carried forward

`Invoke-MemoryBankRouteSelectionEval.ps1` has offline `Prepare` and `Grade`
modes covering prompt isolation, label leakage, fallback, strict shape,
reliability aggregation, and failure accounting. The first stage infers routes
and fallback only; the resolver still receives human labels. Context cost,
latency, and answer quality under routed versus full loading remain unmeasured,
and no precision floor is set. `WindowsAccessControl` slots 1 and 2 use the
older ink-variant reading of dark/light; `brand-logo-system` integration was
measured on one project only; and the `skill-creator` description edit remains
unproven — train reached 100 % while validation fell.

## Next step

The user decides whether to push `ai/rollover-plugin-manifest` and open a PR;
its CI must pass before merging, and the next full release is the first live
proof of the rollover change. No push, merge, release, or installed-Customization
deployment was requested or performed. Grader tests still do not measure native
discovery, model quality, or runtime containment.
